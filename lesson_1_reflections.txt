(Q)How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

well, for one - there are times that the updated "new" file/program is worst than the last version so by having a old 
copy to turn to - one can then undo bad copy.


(Q)What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?


In auto save - it does it in regular intervals so, there is no "forgot" issue but it can get long and tedious saves.
the self save must be done with thought and purpose each time so -  no slob behavior allowed.


(Q) Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?


Because the other version controls are not geared for coding but for docs - one topic - one file


(Q) How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

by typing git log and git diff and the corresponding commit serial number then see added lines and deleted.

(Q) How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

by readily being able to fix error that breaks things.

(Q) Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

some program maybe app
